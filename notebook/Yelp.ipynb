       "['Bostonia Public House is definitely quality over quantity. We came in at 6:00 on a Sunday night with no reservation. It was definitely hopping and we were lucky to snag two seats at the bar. The atmosphere is calm with just a hint of hipster. We were immediately impressed by the wine station! My husband was really impressed with the Guinness pour - crisp, clean and smooth. Mitch was an excellent bar tender - he has that old school charm and flair. We shared the tater tot poutine - that gravy though....girl. And the tots still stayed crisp! So good! I had the hot lobster roll. The bun to lobster ratio was perfect and the lobster tasted amazing! It had a definite butter flavor. Yum! My husband had the burger. It was made with quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. I heard a little happy sigh every time he took a bite. Both meals were served with pickle chips and salt and pepper fries. No extra condiments were needed - not even salt and pepper. Everything was seasoned perfectly! We would definitely come back!',\n",
       " \"Kind of a colonial feel for the place even though it was somewhat recently opened. I guess that's the Boston way, though and I am not complaining. It is cool to do things a little different.We were towards the end of our journey, just killing some time and not super hungry for a meal but we jumped in for a few drinks because of the reviews and this is where wanted to eat the day before but it was closed for an event. It was a little loud, somewhat busy when we came in and we sat at the bar. The bartender was versed and really took his time making each of the drinks along with checking in with everyone around the bar. We got a pear spiced mule which had some ghost tequila in it. A little spicy, which could have been the ginger but it was good. It was a pleasant little burn after each sip. Also got the spiced mulled cider. Spiced rim, subtle flavorings and a smooth finish made this a nice delicate drink and very tasty for a final afternoon in the city.Decided to grab an appetizer just because it sounded too good to miss. Tater tot poutine was excellent. Tots were so perfectly crisp under all that gravy and cheese, every bite a delight. Still, $37 before tip for two drinks and an appetizer is a little steep for me even in the city. But, the taste and care taken with the drinks helps to offset that a bit. Can't 5 star it because we didn't really get much past the drinks and it is a tad pricier than I want it to be. Still, if we were in town we would pop in again.TL;DR: Drinks and app only but each were excellent.\",\n",
       " \"Came here on a Fri night with my mom. Made a reservation and was seated promptly. The location is really close to Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall, which is great.We got the clam chowder to start off with and I ordered the Hot Lobster Roll and my mom got the Duck Confit pasta. The clam chowder was rich and flavorful, but very smooth/puréed - I like mine chunkier. The Lobster Roll was OK...nothing special but decent amount of lobster. My mom's pasta was great and I saw a lot of other people get that dish as well - the noodles tasted hand made.We also got the doughnuts which I thought were overly sweet and dense. Not my thing.FYI service was good and the waiter was attentive with refilling our drinks. The ambience wasn't great if you're bringing a parent since the bar wraps around the restaurant so there was a group of young professional guys getting drunk on top of us.\",\n",
       " \"I can't believe I have never been here before! I made a last minute reservation Saturday morning for brunch at 11:45am. It was actually pretty packed when we got there. The staff was very friendly and informative. There is an ultimate Bloody Mary bar where you can get toppings ranging from bacon wrapped scallops to shrimp and donuts! \\xa0You can also pick whatever vodka you prefer (including top shelf!) I had the crab cake Benedict and it was amazing!!! I would highly recommend. There were a lot of great options. The baked lobster Mac and cheese was a close second choice. We had the bromosas and it was not light on the alcohol. Can't wait to return for the mac and cheese on a cold winter day.\",\n",
       " \"Step two blocks away from all the tourists at Quincy Market for a proper sit-down restaurant with shelves of spirits and a decent selection of beers on tap including their own beer brewed locally by Narragansett. I got the chicken wings to start. Super hot from the fryer and quite delicious though maybe not as meaty as I've had elsewhere. Still, enjoyable once they'd cooled down and I'd have these again.For main, the Bostonia burger was very good but at 6 or so inches tall, not something you're going to pick up and eat. Buttered brioche bun, bacon, arugula and a thick slice of tomato with a burger patty that was about an inch thick on its own. Enjoyable.Fries on the side were a thick cut and perhaps a little underdone from crunchy. Good with the small pot of ketchup but this plate is all about the burger.Great friendly service.\",\n",
       " \"Update: The only reason I can't give this place a 5 star is because the noise is really a lot for the restaurant part of the establishment. That being said, the duck confit pasta. Oh my!!! This is THE most amazing pasta! And this from a woman who loves pasta and has been to Italy multiple times. I don't know how the chef put this together, but you must, you must have this pasta. It's duck con feet with a link weenie, I believe some sort of tomato, garlic, really good olive oil, and the kicker, a mellow goat cheese that creates an almost Alfredo-like creaminess. I still have dreams about it. Also there is a red wine blend called The Prisoner. It's $25 a class. I know, I know. But it is so, so worth it! Don't forget about the sweet potato donut holes. Still kicking butt there! Can't wait to go back!What a great find thanks to the yelp community.This is the place you always wanted, casual enough to drop into without reservations, but classy enough for you to want to stay and have what is definitely an amazing dinner and superb wine. Don't be fooled by the public house moniker, this is a restaurant. And they do food really, really well. Start with the shrimp cocktail with a slightly spicy housemaid cocktail sauce. I then had the stripped loin, which I recommend ordering medium rare. The au gratin potatoes were OK, but the garlic spinach and mushrooms in truffle butter more than made up for it! Ask for Chris at the bar, as he is super attentive and awesome. He turned me on to the sweet potato donut bites that were to die for! I'll definitely be coming back here.\",\n",
       " \"I like that this place has plenty of space and therefore does not have a ridiculously long line. \\xa0I've been three times, once with a reservation, for weekend brunches. \\xa0We've always been seated fairly quickly. \\xa0They often have live music which is usually a nice and chill touch.The last time we went, there were a bunch of new menu items, and they were a hit with our party. \\xa0The eggs benedicts were especially well-liked. \\xa0The tater tot poutine is always smaller than anyone expects (but otherwise good). \\xa0The lobster mac and cheese: there is plenty of it. \\xa0But, it was actually not as well-flavored as anyone would have liked. \\xa0I think the cheeses used led to a somewhat bland and dry mac. \\xa0Mixed drinks tend to be heavily sweetened.\",\n",
       " \"My friends and I made a date to workout in the morning and go to brunch after. One of them suggested we come here to Bostonia because they have Bloody Mary line a mile long where you can create your ultimate Bloody Mary. Well I don't drink so I skipped that but thought it was nice to share for those Bloody Mary drinkers. We kept it simple and ordered a poutine to share and then together we ordered a lobster Mac and cheese, salmon toast and short rib biscuit and gravy. Everything tasted so delightful probably became we were so hungry after our workout. I would like to come back for another meal here. I'm happy my friend suggested this place for brunch. I definitely inhaled my Mac and cheese. It was hot and cheesy with crispy breadcrumbs and nice bites of lobster. I enjoyed it was not overly cheesed and the pasta was cooked al dente. The poutine was delicious and was a great little starter. I really liked how all the dishes were not overly dressed or sauced. This is not always the case in many restaurants.\",\n",
       " \"4 star food...but the noise! \\xa0I literally could not hear my wife next to me. Is this normal? \\xa0According to the waitress, yes. By 8 pm a pianist began and it only served to up the volume. The food was excellent. We had the Polenta Fries w/truffle aioli topped w/parm cheese. Nice crunch on the outside. Good cornmeal flavor and seasoned well. The truffle aioli(mayo) had the perfect level of earthy truffle flavor. I had the BPH Burger. Grass fed ground beef cooked mid rare. Topped w/caramelized onion-sundried tomato jam, Vermont cheddar, smoked bacon, black pepper aioli, sliced pickles on a brioche bun. The burger was well seasoned salty/beefy goodness. The FF were called salt and pepper fries, but tasted no different than any others. I added Bostonia Baked Beans. Such smokey sweet beans! \\xa0Loved them!One of my dining group had the lobster Mac/cheese and said it was the creamiest/cheesiest yet! \\xa0Also salad w/Salmon and Greek salad. 1 app, 4 entrees, 2 beers and 2 drinks $140. Great food, however the noise is not worth it. I won't be back.\",\n",

       " 'TL/DR: poor service, poor value (small portions). Service: sat for 10 minutes before someone came over to us. Eventually ordered and was brought food, but had no place settings. Food sat for several minutes while we waited for them to bring silverware. Not one visit to us after that, so eventually just went over and handed the server my credit card to close us out. Value: ordered the $24 \"Wagyu Corned Beef\" and it was a struggle to find a piece of meat bigger than a few grains of salt stuck together. Eggs were liquid, and hadn\\'t seemed to been cooked at all.I\\'m writing this as I walk back to my hotel in search of a breakfast sandwich on the way back.',\n",
       " \"Upscale-feeling bar with great food and atmosphere. \\xa0A mix of better-than-average, elevated bar food and seafood dishes.Great execution on a salmon dish, with their Faroe Island Salmon. \\xa0Juicy, flaky fish with a beautifully crusty, heavily seasoned savory top. \\xa0It lays on top of a pile of moist orzo in a red pepper sauce. \\xa0My dish seemed to differ a bit from the menu... I believe I got green peas in lieu of pine nuts. \\xa0I wasn't a fan of the peas -- they were harder, almost crunchy, so I assume they were there for some textural contrast. \\xa0Everything else on the plate was fantastic.The star of the dish, and the reason I was attracted to it in the first place, was the lemon sabayon on the salmon; \\xa0lemon juice and fish are a classic match made in heaven, and serving it as a sabayon was a perfect elevation of the concept. \\xa0A slightly sweet but still lemony sauce, it pulled the entire thing together. \\xa0The combination of the salty, savory top of the salmon with the lemon sabayon was the best bite of the night. \\xa0The lemon and the red pepper sauces didn't clash, both worked reasonably well together.The Clam Chowder was thick and creamy, with a generous helping of clams and herbs. \\xa0While there were some chunks of bacon in there, I could have used a lot more. \\xa0I got some grit on a couple bites. \\xa0It was hearty and thick enough where I didn't need oyster crackers. \\xa0The flavor was great with the fresh clams and tons of herbs, so no need for hot sauce. \\xa0(Though, they do give you a cool little mini-bottle of Tabasco!)Lots of smaller details add up to give this place a great ambiance: \\xa0There was a piano man playing some soft but upbeat music in the middle of the bar. \\xa0It's nice and spacious considering it's in downtown Boston. \\xa0The full-service bar has a padded pipe on the edge, so you have something soft to lean your arms on.Staff was professional, well dressed, polite, and attentive. \\xa0Shook my hand as I left. \\xa0I'll certainly be back to try the rest of the menu. \\xa0I've tried several of the appetizers during a separate trip for work, but I don't remember them well enough to give detailed recommendations. \\xa0I do, however, remember enjoying the wings.\",\n",
       " 'Sat at the bar this busy 4th of July day.

Not a bad choice for a meal!',\n",
       " 'Had so much fun here! Not going to lie, I was drawn in because of the Bloody Mary bar and live band and both did not disappoint! The live band on Sunday was fantastic as was my Bloody Mary! I had too much fun building my Bloody Mary but the actual drink itself was really good. The donuts were so yummy! We also ordered the lobster Benedict which was also delish. The live band was so good and it was not too loud when we were there for Sunday brunch. Definitely will be back!!',\n",
       " \"Everything here is exactly how I picture a homey New England brunch to be. I came here with a group of three for Sunday brunch. It was cold and raining the whole of that Sunday day but having brunch here definitely made our day. The portions were huge and great for sharing! We decided to share the Short Rib Biscuit & Gravy which comes with two poached eggs, cheddar cheese biscuit, potatoes and a sweet jam topping. Loved that it's super rich with lots of flavor! The short ribs were generous and tender. The gravy and sweet jam were yummy too. The Confit Duck Hash was also really good. It came with avocado and scrambled eggs. There were heaps of shredded confit duck and they were really tender. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was another great choice. It was really creamy and cheesy with big chunky pieces of lobster throughout. For our sides, we got the Rosemary Polenta Fries and the Tater Tot Poutine. The polenta fries came with a truffle aioli dip, yum! The tater tot poutine was crispy and also delicious with the gravy and melted cheese. I highly recommend getting them. To finish off our brunch, we shared the Warm Sweet Potato Doughnuts. \\xa0These were perfect - fluffy and warm on the inside and paired with a bourbon glaze. We were a fan of the atmosphere here as well - music and service were both on point. There was also a bloody mary bar which was popular among customers too. Would definitely return for the scrumptious brunch!\",\n",

The menu is small and the food was bad- meatball appetizer was hard, the steak we had was terrible and sat in our stomachs all night. Then you get the bill and your shocked! \\xa0The amount we paid, we could of went to Abe and Louies and had a awesome meal. \\xa0The servers were polite but extremely slow... took forever to get menus then for them to return took even longer.

There is great live music Thur-Sat. With that being said, it is a bar atmosphere but it is definitely not bar food.I ordered the fork tender meatballs, the lobster mac and cheese, cold lobster roll with sea salt and pepper fries, and espresso martinis. The meatballs were tender and packed with flavor, the mac and cheese had large pieces of pasta cooked al dente with 3 cheese mornay and HUGE pieces of lobster throughout. The cold lobster roll had bacon, avocado, coriander, and citrus aioli-all the ingredients were different consistencies that really worked together with the roll. The sea salt and pepper fries were the best I've had, I would recommend them as one of your sides. Would return here every weekend if I lived in Boston!\",\n",

We started out our meal with the meatballs, which were steaming hot, with so many layers of flavor they could have been a small meal in and of themselves. We shared a bottle of Saliato Chiorri wine which was recommended by our waiter. It was a perfect match for our meal, which continued with the carbonara and crazy fettuccine. Both were fabulous and the care that went into the handmade pasta was obvious.

We started out our meal with the meatballs, which were steaming hot, with so many layers of flavor they could have been a small meal in and of themselves. We shared a bottle of Saliato Chiorri wine which was recommended by our waiter. It was a perfect match for our meal, which continued with the carbonara and crazy fettuccine. Both were fabulous and the care that went into the handmade pasta was obvious. Add all this together, along with a friendly and attentive wait staff, a cozy atmosphere, and a total cost of $83, and it's obvious why Carmelina's gets such high marks!Buon appetito!\",\n",

I suggest making a reservation well in advance because tables fill up real quick during the weekends. My favorite things on their menu is definitely their mushroom risotto and the meatballs. The risotto has a variety of mushroom and it has a beautiful truffle flavor. The meatballs are amazing ! Super well seasoned and flavored and the red sauce it comes in is so good! They are baked and have cheese on top and there's no other meatball that beats these. Other good dishes are their spicy sausage pasta as well as their mushroom rigatoni.

If you sit at the bar, you'll be able to watch the chefs prepare the food right before your eyes, which is kind of neat.Despite all the fanciness, it's not the whole nine yards that you might receive at other restaurants - likely because they're trying to get people in and out more quickly here. If you want a place to relax and dine for multiple hours, you might feel a bit rushed or under-pampered at Carmelina's.My biggest issue, though, was with the food quality. I ordered the stuffed pork chop, which sounded like a delicious proposition: 16 oz if pork chop, stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto. But the meat was dry and lacking in juicy flavor.

The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. Chicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce. It\\'s a sight to behold. And what takes this dish over the top is the sopresatta. Subtle, yet it makes all the difference.Carmelina\\'s isn\\'t exactly a hidden gem.

The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. Chicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce.

If you want a place to relax and dine for multiple hours, you might feel a bit rushed or under-pampered at Carmelina's.My biggest issue, though, was with the food quality. I ordered the stuffed pork chop, which sounded like a delicious proposition: 16 oz if pork chop, stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto. But the meat was dry and lacking in juicy flavor. The accompanying veggies were nice, but they were drowned in a bit too much marinara sauce.I only tried one thing on the menu, so your mileage may vary.

The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. Chicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce.

That is very much evident after just one bite. There aren\\'t many things more satisfying than perfectly al dente pasta. The complimentary bread is soooo good, a hybrid of focaccia and dinner roll. The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. Chicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce. It\\'s a sight to behold. And what takes this dish over the top is the sopresatta. Subtle, yet it makes all the difference.Carmelina\\'s isn\\'t exactly a hidden gem. Not only is it on the North End\\'s main strip, but it boasts a pretty impressive number of yelp reviews. As always, I\\'m late to the party. As for you fellow food lover, make your way to Carmelina\\'s pronto. Tip: so the reservation thing is kind of a big deal. Tables are booked at least a week out.

The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. Chicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce.

We also had the calamari and mussels dish. It wasn't terrible except the noodles were cooked poorly and all clumped together. We had to use our forks to separate all the clumps. And it just didn't come close to the pasta and ahi tuna dish in taste either. Overall, this rating is for the food. Service itself would have been 1 Star.\"],\n",
       " [\"THE best meal my wife and I had while in Boston! I had bookmarked \\xa0Carmelina's before coming to town and couldn't help but notice it made the Boston Elite Team's list as well. For good reason!You are going to want to have dinner here so, if you don't want to stand in line, make your reservations early. There are only 11 tables and 5 bar stools. We started out our meal with the meatballs, which were steaming hot, with so many layers of flavor they could have been a small meal in and of themselves. We shared a bottle of Saliato Chiorri wine which was recommended by our waiter. It was a perfect match for our meal, which continued with the carbonara and crazy fettuccine. Both were fabulous and the care that went into the handmade pasta was obvious. Add all this together, along with a friendly and attentive wait staff, a cozy atmosphere, and a total cost of $83, and it's obvious why Carmelina's gets such high marks!Buon appetito!\",\n",
       "  \"I had this restaurant bookmarked for my weekend trip to Boston! I did not do my research before hand so let me help you by reminding you to MAKE A RESERVATION. My husband and I were LUCKY to have nabbed an open reservation on a Saturday evening.The decor was gorgeous. The setting was intimate and romantic and I absolutely appreciate that it was a casual atmosphere. My husband and I went directly to ordering drinks and our entrees.I had the Cherry Pie Pinot Noir. He had the Crazy Alfredo and I had the Penne Capricciose. Hands down the best Italian food I've ever had in my entire life. We also had the Pan Roasted Chicken Breast with garlic and rosemary, artichoke hearts, served aside lemony arugula salad. Mouth-watering and to die for! I cannot wait to be in Boston again! Service was excellent as well. If you're in Boston, this restaurant is a MUST!!!\",\n",
       "  \"Love Carmelina's!The service was fabulous and the food was to die for. I can't wait to go back! Also fun to just grab a drink or an app at the bar!\",\n",
       "  'Great atmosphere, delicious authentic Italian food and friendly staff. The wild mushroom risotto \\xa0appetizer is a must try even if you don\\'t like mushrooms. You could actually see and taste the truffles! Main entree- I don\\'t think you can go wrong with any of the options. I ordered seafood \"fruitti de mari\" basically seafood pasta platter. They don\\'t skimp on the seafood, it was perfectly cooked and not dry and sauce was mouth watering. My fiancée ordered the Fettuccini Carmelina- on the special menu which was, again, full of seafood including perfectly seared scallops. \\xa0In addition, they have bunch of Italian wine options for reasonable price that tasted amazing! Overall, other than actually eating in Italy, this is the first place back in the US that has reminded me of authentic Italian food and wine. Things to consider: must make reservation during the weekends given the popularity here. It\\'s small space so may not be best for large groups with kids...',\n",
       "  \"Holy cacio di Pepe Batman. \\xa0This place is amazing.We stopped in last week for lunch and had the best pasta I've eaten in a restaurant in ages... \\xa0We started with the meatballs, cause um, that had to happen. \\xa0They delivered exactly what I wanted. \\xa0And then we had the tuna salad- which I didn't want to order but I'm so glad I did. \\xa0Shaved fennel, brined black olives, and fresh seared tuna... \\xa0it was amazing. Truly. \\xa0I'd order it again in a heartbeat.We also got cacio di Pepe and it was so delightful- I thought it would be too simple but it was everything. \\xa0The flavors were perfectly balanced, the pasta was al dente... \\xa0perfection.And we got the baked mushroom pasta. \\xa0In a meal full of surprises this was no exception. \\xa0We were expecting a drier dish, but this was far from it. \\xa0Fresh mushrooms, creamy cheese... a little crisp on top... \\xa0it was amazing. \\xa0Not like a regular dry baked pasta casserole at all.This place is totally worth any wait, it's incredible. \\xa0Of course the service was great and the big open windows on a nice afternoon are perfect to watch the folks on the street while you dine...\",\n",
       "  \"Love Carmelina's! A cute family styled Italian restaurant located in the North End. Perfect location with Mike's Pastries right across the street. We ordered the gnocchi, seared tuna appetizer, fried calamari, the Sunday Macaroni and the rolled prosciutto pasta. Was not disappointed with what we ordered! My only complaint is that the prosciutto pasta was a little salty but that's understandable given cured meats are typically on the saltier side.All of the waiters were great. I love how all of the waiters help out and you're not just assigned to one person to serve you. We made reservations for 12:15. Make sure you do too! We arrived right when they opened and within 15 minutes, the place was crowded!IG: @twomorebites\",\n",
       "  \"Amazing and Delicious food!We are not from this area and we were trying to find good food. We got there and they told us the wait time was about 45 minutes to an hour.We decide to wait and and it was worth it!!Service was great, the bread was delicious and the food was the best!I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed.Best Italian food I ever had!\",\n",
       "  \"This is one of the best Italian meals I've ever had! Situated in the North End of Boston, this small restaurant is home to delicious, authentic Italian food with a intimate atmosphere and friendly staff. I waited an hour and 15 minutes for a seat at the bar (make reservations or get their early like I did to get your name on the list while you walk around Boston). Let me tell you, the wait was worth it! If you sit at the bar, you can see into the little kitchen and watch all the mouth-watering food go out to tables. I went with the calamari for an appetizer which was pretty good, but the Gnocchi al Forno was a home run. The little potato dumplings were soft, pillowy and melted in your mouth! I am so happy I went out of my way to dine here while visiting Boston and I promise it is worth it!\",\n",

       "  \"Wow! This place is delightful. I'd have to commend the staff of 3 servers here. They are on point and totally hustled to host, serve, and clear tables in lightening speed. The food was good...mushroom risotto devoured in no time, this huge plate full of meat balls, pasta, and short rib were good but huge. This is definitely to share with a party larger than 2 if there are more dishes ordered. I wish the server would have told us that b/c had so much food left over. Anyway, our server was still nice. Oh , the clams dish here is to die for!!! Gotta try this place!\",\n",

       "  'This restaurant is perfect for a family setting. I initially had planned to go to The Daily Catch a few doors down but seeing the customer service as I waited turned me and my family away. The hostess politely accommodated my family and I and the waitress (nice young lady) served us well. We ordered the calamari, veal meatballs, rock shrimp, 2 Alfredo pasta and the chicken parm. All of our meals came out delicious. We also noticed that the pasta was freshly hand made. Our meals came in a timely manner with the complimentary bread. The Restaurant itself was very clean and modern looking. It is a little bigger than most restaurants on the north end. I will most definitely be back and would recommend this restaurant.',\n",
       "  \"The only reason I'm giving Carmelina's 5 stars is because 6 isn't an option. These chefs crank out masterpieces EVERY SINGLE TIME. The pasta in itself is a work of art. The sauces and sides compliment the pasta perfectly. Legit plates from heaven. The atmosphere is so friendly and romantic. My husband is already trying to figure out how we can fit this in to our agenda tomorrow as well.\",\n",
       "  'Ms Carmelina, you have won my heart. Ive long perused your North End neighborhood in search of something special, in a sea of so called \"amazing\" Italian dining. How many times did I walk by you over the years, completely obviously to the treasure that lied between your walls. Search no more...fork drop. (Symbolic of course, don\\'t want to cause a scene). Carmelina\\'s serves traditional Sicilian comfort food with a Mediterranean twist. A classic Italian dish, done the right way, needs no additives. Trust me I get it, I\\'m a purest at heart. But on a few rare occasions, a little off center can be equally as good, if not better.You can bet anything coming out of the kitchen, including Pasta, is scratch made. That is very much evident after just one bite. There aren\\'t many things more satisfying than perfectly al dente pasta. The complimentary bread is soooo good, a hybrid of focaccia and dinner roll. The penne Gorgonzola is also wonderful, but nothing beats the one and only(drum roll please)....Crazy Alfredo. Chicken, sausage, roasted red pepper, in some sort of non traditional Alfredo sauce. It\\'s a sight to behold. And what takes this dish over the top is the sopresatta. Subtle, yet it makes all the difference.Carmelina\\'s isn\\'t exactly a hidden gem. Not only is it on the North End\\'s main strip, but it boasts a pretty impressive number of yelp reviews. As always, I\\'m late to the party. As for you fellow food lover, make your way to Carmelina\\'s pronto. Tip: so the reservation thing is kind of a big deal. Tables are booked at least a week out. If you are a party of 1 or 2, walkins are not only acceptable, but there\\'s a great chance you won\\'t be waiting long. Party of 3 or more? Absolutely no chance. Won\\'t even take your name down.',\n",
       "  \"Carmelina's is a hopping Italian restaurant in Boston's North End offering an intimate and refined environment but mediocre food.The place is packed, and getting a table can be tricky. Be prepared to get a bit cozy with your neighbors (or your date ). If you sit at the bar, you'll be able to watch the chefs prepare the food right before your eyes, which is kind of neat.Despite all the fanciness, it's not the whole nine yards that you might receive at other restaurants - likely because they're trying to get people in and out more quickly here. If you want a place to relax and dine for multiple hours, you might feel a bit rushed or under-pampered at Carmelina's.My biggest issue, though, was with the food quality. I ordered the stuffed pork chop, which sounded like a delicious proposition: 16 oz if pork chop, stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto. But the meat was dry and lacking in juicy flavor. The accompanying veggies were nice, but they were drowned in a bit too much marinara sauce.I only tried one thing on the menu, so your mileage may vary. But I'll likely patron a different Italian restaurant in the North End next time I'm back.\",\n",
       "  \"We made reservations via OpenTable for dinner at 7:30 on a Tuesday and it was incredibly lively and thriving with as much energy as a Saturday night.We were seated immediately in the very small, intimate resturant. The tables are very close together and I listened to our neighboring table-mates cry over their pending divorces. Again, super intimate!We had the meatballs, gnocchi and Sunday Macaroni. All were incredible and we took a LOT of it to go. It was dense but in the most heavenly of ways. The only thing I didn't care for was the bread. It just wasn't my style, but it didn't bother me at all as it wasn't what we came for.Note that they do not serve dessert or coffee as they encourage you to visit the neighboring resturants and support the neighborhood as a whole!\",\n",
       "  \"I can't believe I've been to Carmelina's four times without writing a review!! This place is absolutely delicious and honestly my favorite in all of the north end. There is always a wait and I've only been able o get seated once when I didn't have a reservation. I suggest making a reservation well in advance because tables fill up real quick during the weekends. My favorite things on their menu is definitely their mushroom risotto and the meatballs. The risotto has a variety of mushroom and it has a beautiful truffle flavor. The meatballs are amazing ! Super well seasoned and flavored and the red sauce it comes in is so good! They are baked and have cheese on top and there's no other meatball that beats these. Other good dishes are their spicy sausage pasta as well as their mushroom rigatoni. The complimentary bread they serve is also good. Service is good with an overall friendly and patient staff.\",\n",
       "  \"This is my all time favorite restaurant in Boston. Best date night spot. Best place to take friends when the visit. Best place in general. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\",\n",
       "  \"Very disappointed. I have never left tips lower than 18% until today. I rarely give one star to any business establishment.At 1:30pm, \\xa0I walked in myself, there are only two servers. Not crazy busy. A girl server looked at me and walked away and wiped tables and \\xa0started mixing olive oil and balsamic for the customers. No greeting to me. I needed to walk up to a man server to ask for a table or a bar seat. I got seated after waiting at the entrance for a while. An elder couple got a high table and waited for 5 minutes, no acknowledgement to them and no menu for them, They left. A man server took my order and got my order. The Vongole was nothing remarkable. ( I always order Vongole pasta whenever I go to Italian restaurants). No bread for me. No one never checked with me until I asked for a check. I don't mean to rain on everybody's parade, but I needed to express my disappointment. Won't be back.\",\n",
       "  \"Came here with my mom and sister and we were told the wait would be 5min...that was a lie. It was more like 20-30min and we were in time a crunch so it was definitely stressful waiting much longer than we were lead on. When we were seated, we put our order in quickly and was told the bread would come fresh out of the oven in a few minutes. Then we saw the bread come out and sit on the counter for 10min while other tables who came after us got some and we didn't. Another 25min pass by and our food finally comes out. At this point we were getting very hungry and anxious about missing our next appointment. It doesn't sound like a good time so far right? It wasn't. But holy moly was the FOOD DELICIOUS!! \\xa0It definitely made up for the lame experience so far. I highly recommended the pasta with ahi tuna dish. I didn't even know that existed but now I can never go back to a world without this entree. The calamari salad was also very fresh. More greens would have been appreciated but they were generous with the squid and octopus and anti-pasta items mixed in there (picked carrots, olives, banana peppers).
